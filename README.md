 # shoppingcart

for this particular project i use tailwind css

first install
npx install -D tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init


add the content in the tailwind.config.js file

module.exports = {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{html,js}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}

last step import utilites in index.css
Add the @tailwind directives for each of Tailwindâ€™s layers to your main CSS file.
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

# next add redux tool kit
npx i @reduxjs/toolkit
npx i @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux react-icons react-router-dom react-loder-spinner 

# store 

configureStore:

A function from @reduxjs/toolkit that simplifies store configuration by setting up sensible defaults.

cartReducer:

A reducer function that handles state changes for the cart slice of your state. It listens for specific action types and updates the state accordingly.

reducer:

An object where you define all your slice reducers. Each key in this object corresponds to a slice of your state, and each value is a reducer function handling state updates for that slice.

# in the cart-slice
add to the cart and remove from the cart is defined and exported
const initialState = []

const cartSlice = createSlice({
  name:'cart',
  initialState,
  reducers : {
    addToCart(state,action){
      state.push(action.payload)
    },
    removeFromCart(state,action){
    return  state.filter((item)=>item.id !== action.payload)
    }
  }
})

export const {addToCart,removeFromCart} = cartSlice.actions
export default cartSlice.reducer


1. name:
Purpose: The name property in the createSlice function is used to uniquely identify the slice of the state. This name is used internally by Redux Toolkit for various purposes, such as generating action type strings.

Example: If name is set to 'cart', the action types generated for the reducers would be 'cart/addToCart' and 'cart/removeFromCart'.

2. cartSlice.reducer:
Purpose: The cartSlice.reducer is the reducer function generated by the createSlice function. This reducer handles the state changes based on the actions defined in the reducers property.

Usage: When you configure your Redux store, you pass this reducer to the configureStore function to manage the state of the cart slice.


# extracting data  from cart
const cart = useSelector(state => state.cart);
useSelector Hook:

When you want to access the Redux state directly within a component.

To avoid prop drilling and simplify state management.

The useSelector hook allows you to extract data from the Redux store state. The function passed to useSelector (the selector) determines which part of the state you want to access.

Selector Function:

In const cart = useSelector(state => state.cart);, the selector function state => state.cart extracts the cart slice from the entire Redux state.

# calculating total price
const totalPrice = cart.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr.price, 0);
# Array.prototype.reduce():

The reduce method executes a reducer function (that you provide) on each element of the array, 
resulting in a single output value.
